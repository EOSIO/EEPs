We have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs. It will merge yours immediately if certain criteria are met:

 - The PR edits only existing draft PRs.
 - The build passes.
 - Your Github username or email address is listed in the 'author' header of all affected PRs, inside <triangular brackets>.
 - If matching on email address, the email address is the one publicly listed on your GitHub profile.
