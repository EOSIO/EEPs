## Simple summary

This proposal describes a way for DOM environments to expose an Ethereum provider API that requires user approval.

## Abstract

The previous generation of Ethereum-enabled DOM environments follows a pattern of directly injecting a provider object into the DOM without user consent. This exposes users of such environments to fingerprinting attacks since untrusted websites can check for the injected provider and reliably identify Ethereum-enabled clients.

This proposal outlines a protocol in which dapps request access to an Ethereum provider API.

## Specification

### Typical dapp initialization

```
START dapp
IF web3 is defined
    CONTINUE dapp
IF web3 is undefined
    STOP dapp
```

### Proposed dapp initialization

```
START dapp
REQUEST[1] Ethereum provider
IF user approves
    INJECT[2] provider API
    NOTIFY[3] dapp
    CONTINUE dapp
IF user rejects
IF non-Ethereum environment
    NOOP[4]
```

#### `[1] REQUEST`

Dapps MUST request an Ethereum provider API by sending a message using the [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API. This message MUST be sent with a payload object containing a `type` property with a value of ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_REQUEST and an optional `id` property corresponding to an identifier of a specific wallet provider, such as "METAMASK".

#### `[2] INJECT`

Ethereum-enabled DOM environments MUST expose an Ethereum provider API as a global `ethereum` variable on the `window` object.

#### `[3] NOTIFY`

Ethereum-enabled DOM environments MUST notify dapps of successful provider API exposure by sending a message using the [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) API. This message MUST be sent with a payload object containing a `type` property with a value of ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_SUCCESS" and an optional `id` property corresponding to an identifier of a specific wallet provider, such as "METAMASK"

#### `[4] NOOP`

If a user rejects access to the Ethereum provider API on an untrusted site, the site itself MUST NOT be notified in any way; notification of a rejection would allow third-party tools to still identify that a client is Ethereum-enabled despite not being granted access to any provider API.

### Example implementation: `postMessage`

The following example demonstrates one possible implementation of this strategy in a browser-based DOM environment. Note that Ethereum-enabled environments on other platforms would most likely use platform-specific native messaging protocols, not `postMessage`.

```js
// Listen for provider API exposure
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
    if (!event.data || !event.data.type) { return; }
    if (event.data.type === 'ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_SUCCESS') {
        // Provider API exposed, continue
        const networkVersion = await ethereum.send('net_version', []);
        console.log(networkVersion);
    }
});
// Request Provider API
window.postMessage({ type: 'ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_REQUEST' });
```

## Rationale

The pattern of provider auto-injection followed by the previous generation of Ethereum-enabled DOM environements failed to protect user privacy by allowing untrusted websites to uniquely identify Ethereum users. This proposal establishes a new pattern wherein dapps must request access to an Ethereum provider API. This protocol directly prevents fingerprinting attacks by giving users the ability to reject provider exposure on a given website.

### Constraints

* A provider API MUST NOT be exposed to websites by default.
* Dapps MUST request a provider API if it does not exist.
* Users MUST be able to approve or reject provider API access.
* A provider API MUST be exposed to websites after user consent.
* Environments MAY continue auto-exposing a provider API if users can opt-out.

### Immediate value-add

* Users can reject provider API access on untrusted sites to prevent fingerprinting.

### Long-term value-add

* Dapps could request specific account information based on user consent.
* Dapps could request specific user information based on user consent (uPort, DIDs).
* Dapps could request a specific network based on user consent.
* Dapps could request multiple instances of the above based on user consent.

## Backwards compatibility

This proposal impacts dapp authors and requires that they request access to an Ethereum provider API before using it. This proposal also impacts developers of Ethereum-enabled environments or dapp browsers as these tools should no longer auto-expose any provider API; instead, they should only do so if a website requests a provider API and if the user consents to its access. Environments may continue to auto-expose an Ethereum provider API as long as users have the ability to disable this behavior.

## Implementation

The MetaMask team is currently working an [MVP implementation](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/4703) of the strategy described above and expects to begin limited user testing soon.
